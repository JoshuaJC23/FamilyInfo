                <p>Joshua grew up in a family of seven boys.  He is the second to youngest. Early memories that he has is playing family
                    basketball every Saturday morning in the church gym. He grew up playing sports, mainly basketball and baseball.
                    From ages 12 to 16 Josh went to basketball camps at BYU with his brother and cousin. But, he played tennis in high
                    school and did a few tennis camps at BYU. Those were some good times staying at his grandmas house in provo; he loves
                    her for hosting him and putting up with him all those years. He graduated from Bingham High School and went on a two
                    year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in the Washington, Spokane spanish speaking mission.
                    After the mission he went to Salt Lake Community College and got his Associates degree before transfering to the
                    University of Utah. There he got his Bachelors degree in Exercise and Sports Science. While working he took a web
                    development bootcamp. He is still progressing towards getting a job as a web developer. He is 34 years of age.
                    He is married to Sierra Nielson Christensen whom he met at a singles ward church activity. He was approached by Sierra
                    while playing basketball in the church gym. That night they talked for a few hours before exchanging telephone numbers.
                    It took Josh a few times hanging out with Sierra in groups before he asked her on a first date.  Dating was fun and very
                    frequent, practically every night.
