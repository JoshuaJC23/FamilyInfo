                <p>Sierra grew up with an older sister and two younger brothers.  She was a softball player from
                    a very young age. Her dad would have her and her sister throw multiple pitches everyday. Along with that,
                    she would take batting practice for developing her swing. Sierra ended up going to Brighton High School
                    where she played softball and became one of the best pitchers in the state. After high school Sierra went to
                    Utah Valley University where she studied Criminology for four years.  After graduating she got an internship
                    with the city of South Jordan for a paralegal position.  Upon completing her internship Sierra got a full time
                    job with the city of Murray as a paralegal.  There she remained for about three years before leaving on
                    maternity leave with her first child.  Not knowing if she was going to return or go back to work; spending
                    time with the baby helped make her decision to quit her job and remain at home with the newborn.
                    She in now a stay at home mother with two young but energetic boys and loves it other than the fact
                    that they are daddy boys. She loves being a mother and watching the boys grow up; she also loves
                    taking them out to do activities.
