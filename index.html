                    The Christensen family was established July 25, 2013. Two individuals met at church and decided to
                    get to know each other a little more.
                    Dating was on the radar after having spent time in group activities for a couple of months.
                    After multiple dates and long nights talking, eventually marriage came into the conversation.
                    The dating had its up and downs, but the two held it together and soon became engaged.
                    After Six years of marriage the time for kids had come, with some un-needed nagging. Luckily before
                    the decision to have kids, many adventures were taken.
                    In 2019, one boy joined the family with his brother joining in 2021.
                    Ten years of marriage, also with ups and downs, they are holding strong, even if they have been in
                    the
                    in-laws house for the whole time. The kids have been more than expected. Wild and smart with
                    creative minds and loving hearts.
                    The family is still young and looking forward to many more adventures.
